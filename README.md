<h1 align="center"><img src="https://github.com/BrianLipscombe/radiology-outpatient-board/blob/main/static/images/banner.jpg?raw=true" /></h1>

This is Brian Lipscombe's third Milestone Project at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net). It was built using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python+Flask, MongoDB, Gitpod, and deployed on the hosting platform Heroku. It is designed with Code Institute's Assessment Handbook Project Idea 0 in mind - Bring your own idea to life, based on providing value to users to address a specific real or imagined need.

It is intended to provide management support and to serve as a reminder to diagnostic medical imgaging techs of outpatient appointments scheduled within a radiology department. In a busy hospital setting, balancing scheduled appointments for outpatients with spontaneous STAT orders constantly being placed from the Emergency Department as well as prolonged, complicated exam orders from the Intensive Care Unit can be very challenging, and an app like this could provide some added organization.  

The app can be found [here.](https://8080-brianlipscombe-radiology-2sjdmmrwjw4.ws-us31.gitpod.io/get_tasks)

## User Experience (UX)

* User Stories

    1. Visitor Goals

    - Register
    - Add orders
    - Edit orders

    2. Owner Goals
        
    - Manage outpatient orders for effeciently
    - Ensure only registered staff memnbers have access to the app to protect patient information
    - Allow users to add and edit order information
    - Allow users to add comments to help expedite appointments 

* Design

    1. Color Scheme

        Black is used for each collapsible header to represent radiology which in some hospitals radiology techs wear black scrubs. White with a bit transparency is used to add proper contrast against the black headers.  

    2. Imagery

        The background image was taken from the UCI Medical Center website [here](https://uci.edu/presidential-gateway/overview/_img/overview-future-hospital-1200x570.jpg) then modified using Adobe Photoshop.

    3. Typography

        The fonts are kept basic for easy readability.

* Wireframe
